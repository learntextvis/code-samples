## Notes

the textAnalysisSuite code is this dude's:
https://github.com/Syeoryn/textAnalysisSuite/blob/master/tryMeOut.js

I ran browserify to try it out in browser.  I don't really understand how to use the TFIDF part yet, since it updates the storage for each document sequentially, but maybe i'm being dense.

This is Jason Davies wordcloud layout.

And a simple wordCount.js I grabbed off someone to play with.
