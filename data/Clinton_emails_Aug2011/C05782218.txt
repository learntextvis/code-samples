LAHORE (AP) - Police say they have arrested three people suspected of belonging to the gang that abducted a 70-year-old American development expert in Pakistan earlier this month.
Lahore police chief Malik Ahmed Raza said Wednesday the arrests were made after officers tracked cell phone numbers. He gave no more details.
Warren Weinstein was seized by up to 10 gunmen from his home on Aug. 13 in the city of Lahore. Authorities have not said who they believe seized him, though Islamist militants or criminal gangs seeking ransom are both possibilities.
