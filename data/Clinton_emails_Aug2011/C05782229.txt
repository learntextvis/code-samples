Jake: To bring you up to date: Mirgolikhan family arrived in Minneapolis. No problems with visas or entry. Anticipate visit to prison tomorrow. Iranian MFA alleging untreated medical (chest) condition. Prison would not give us details without a waiver from prisoner, who reportedly wanted to be sure medical personnel would be available during family visit. All of us believe we're being set up for some kind of negative story. We are following and will keep you advised.
