From: Toiv, Nora F Sent: Monday, September 26, 2011 10:01 AM To: Mills, Cheryl 0 Subject: NEW COLIN POWELL BOOK IN MAY
NEW COLIN POWELL BOOK IN MAY: "HarperCollins has acquired the rights to a new book by Colin Powell called 'It Worked For Me: Lessons in Leadership and Life,' written with collaborator Tony Koltz, ... a collection of lessons and personal anecdotes that have driven the four star-general and former Secretary of State's legendary career in public service. [The book leads] off with Powell's '13 Rules,' culled from scraps of paper that he accumulated at his desk and are now used in leadership presentations throughout the world ... Powell's short-but-sweet rules-like 'Get mad, then get over it' and 'Share credit'-set the tone for the rest of his book, in which he tells revealing personal stories to expand on his principles for effective leadership: conviction, hard work, and above all, respect for others. In work and life, Powell writes, 'It is the human gesture that counts."
