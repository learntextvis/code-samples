Dipu Moni to meet Hillary on Oct 12
Foreign Minister Dipu Moni will meet with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Washington DC on October 12.
"Although there is no specific agenda for discussion with Hillary, the foreign minister is expected to discuss bilateral issues, as well as regional and international issues with the US secretary of state," said a source in the foreign ministry.
Dipu Moni left Dhaka yesterday for Kuwait to participate in a two-day event of the loth ministerial meeting of the Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) from October 10 to 11.
Sources said she will attend the opening ceremony of ACD, and then leave for USA to take part in Bangladesh Brand Forum's seminar and a roundtable on Trade and Investment Opportunities in Bangladesh on October
Dipu Moni had last held talks with Hillary during the UN General Assembly in September 2009.
Sources said Dipu Moni may seek US assistance in repatriation of the condemned killers of Bangabandhu to bring them to justice and US support for trial of war criminals.
She is also due to meet with several US Senators and Congressmen at Capital Hill. The foreign minister will attend a reception to be hosted by the Bangladesh embassy in USA.
There was a move to arrange a brief meeting between Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and US President Barack Obama or Hillary during this year's UN General Assembly. But neither Hasina nor Dipu Moni got any appointment for a meeting, said sources.
